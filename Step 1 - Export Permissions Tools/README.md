 Exchange Migration Assessment Tool


Use the script or the tool.
Both will export the same data in different way.

Tool is still in under development, so consider as a beta version.
At the moment SendOnBehlf and Folder Permissions are not exported. This functionality will be added later.


Check [Documentation] pages for information.


The ExportScript.T2T.ps1 is a porting of the script to allow to get Exchange permissions from Office 365.
This scenario cames up from a particular requirement from a customer that need to migrate Tenant2Tenant and wants to create migration batches.
