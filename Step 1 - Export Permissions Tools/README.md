 Exchange Migration Assessment Tool


Use the PowerShell script (ExportScript.ps1) to export all the types of permissions. For Folder Permissions, Exchange 2010+ is required.

The tool (.exe), that export the same data of PowerShell script, but in a different way, is still in under development, so consider as a beta version. At the moment SendOnBehlf and Folder Permissions are not exported by the tool (.exe). This functionality will be added later.

Check [Documentation] pages for information.

The ExportScript.T2T.ps1 is a porting of the script to allow to get Exchange permissions from Office 365.
This scenario cames up from a particular requirement from a customer that need to migrate Tenant2Tenant and wants to create migration batches.
