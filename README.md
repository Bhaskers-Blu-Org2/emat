 Exchange Migration Assessment Tool


Exchange Migration Assessment Tool helps to create migration groups based on relationship between mailboxes (Mailbox, AD, SendOnBehalf and Folder Permissions).
Download and execute the PowerShell script to export all required data in the required format.
The PowerShell script is available in the "Step 1 - Export Permissions Tools" section

Use the tool to calculate groups in the "Step 2 - Normalize and calculate groups" section

A trial of an executable that is able to export data faster is available in the Downloads section.
Consider it as an "alpha" that is still under development. No ETA at the moment.

Please refer to the Wiki Pages for details.
